RickdiculouslyEasy – Security Assessment Summary
================================================

Overview
--------
This project documents a full attack chain performed against the "RickdiculouslyEasy" vulnerable virtual machine. 
The objective of the assessment was to identify security weaknesses, demonstrate realistic exploitation paths, and 
achieve full system compromise by chaining multiple low- to high-impact vulnerabilities.

This engagement focuses on methodology, root cause analysis, and impact, rather than tool-centric exploitation.


Attack Chain Summary
--------------------

1. Initial Access – OS Command Injection
A CGI-based web endpoint was found to be vulnerable to OS command injection due to improper input validation. 
This vulnerability allowed arbitrary command execution, which was used to enumerate system users by accessing 
system-level files.

Impact:
- Disclosure of valid local usernames
- Establishment of a reliable initial foothold


2. Information Disclosure – Exposed Web Resources
Multiple sensitive files were accessible through web-exposed directories without authentication. 
These resources contained plaintext credentials and challenge secrets.

Impact:
- Credential disclosure
- Increased attack surface through credential reuse


3. Authenticated Access – SSH (User-Level)
Using disclosed credentials, authenticated SSH access was obtained as a standard user. 
This access enabled local enumeration and post-exploitation activities.

Impact:
- Remote authenticated access
- Transition from external to internal attacker perspective


4. Post-Exploitation – Sensitive File Discovery
User-owned files were discovered containing sensitive information and secrets relevant to protected resources.
These files provided additional clues that enabled further access escalation.

Impact:
- Internal data exposure
- Credential-related information disclosure


5. Local Binary Execution – Secret Decryption
A user-accessible executable binary was identified that decrypted protected data when supplied with a recovered secret.
This resulted in the disclosure of password hints for a higher-privileged account.

Impact:
- Disclosure of protected secrets
- Facilitation of further credential compromise


6. Credential Derivation – Weak Password Policy
Recovered password hints revealed a predictable password pattern. 
A small, targeted password list was generated based on these constraints and successfully used to authenticate 
as a higher-privileged user.

Impact:
- Compromise of privileged user account
- Demonstration of weak password policy enforcement


7. Privilege Escalation – Sudo Misconfiguration
The compromised privileged user was permitted to execute all commands with sudo without restriction.
This misconfiguration enabled immediate escalation to full administrative (root) access.

Impact:
- Complete system compromise
- Loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability


8. Post-Exploitation – Root-Level Data Access
After escalating privileges, sensitive files located in root-owned directories were accessed, confirming 
full control over the target system.

Impact:
- Total system compromise
- Unrestricted access to sensitive root-level data


Root Causes Identified
----------------------
- Improper input validation (OS command injection)
- Insecure exposure of sensitive web resources
- Plaintext credential storage
- Weak and predictable password policies
- Credential reuse across services
- Misconfigured sudo permissions


Final Impact
------------
By chaining multiple vulnerabilities, full administrative access to the system was achieved.
While several issues were individually moderate in severity, their combination resulted in a critical security failure.


Conclusion
----------
This assessment highlights how common configuration errors, weak credential management, and insufficient access controls 
can be combined to compromise an entire system. The vulnerabilities identified in this project reflect realistic issues 
frequently observed in real-world environments.
